#Checkpoints - Part 1
#Checkpoint 1: Data Cleaning 1
#Load the companies and rounds data (provided on the previous page) into two data frames and name them companies and rounds2 respectively.

#As the values in the companies.txt are tab-delimited, we shall use the read.delim() function

companies<- read.delim("companies.txt",header = TRUE, sep='\t', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#To load the rounds.csv file, we shall use the read.csv() function

rounds2 <- read.csv("rounds2.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Table 1.1: The table below is just for reference - you need to fill out the spreadsheet which is attached in the download section. This holds true for all the tables.

#Results Expected: Table 1.1
# Table 1.1: Understand the Data Set 
#
#How many unique companies are present in rounds2?
#The distinct() function with the tolower() function are used with nrow() to return the number of distinct companies in rounds2

#In the companies data frame, which column can be used as the unique key for each company? Write the name of the column.
#permalink, because the name column does not have unique values
#Are there any companies in the rounds2 file which are not present in companies? Answer yes or no: Y/N
#N - A vlookup in Excel provides this result
#Merge the two data frames so that all variables (columns) in the companies frame are added to the rounds2 data frame. Name the merged frame master_frame. How many observations are present in master_frame?
# we shall create a common column name in rounds2 and companies
rounds2 <- mutate(rounds2, permalink = str_to_lower(rounds2$company_permalink))

#Checkpoint 2: Funding Type Analysis

top9 <- head(sorted_sum_venture_country,9)

#Identify the top three English-speaking countries in the data frame top9
# For the list of English-speaking countries, we need to refer http://www.emmir.org/fileadmin/user_upload/admission/Countries_where_English_is_an_official_language.pdf

#since the sector columns are not variables, we shall convert them into key-value pairs using the gather() function
